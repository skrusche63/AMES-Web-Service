Name:
Ad-hoc Mobile Ecosystem - Web Service development framework

Short Name:
AMES-Web-Service

Abstract:
AMES Web Service is the next OSS contribution of German IT-Amt Bw and is the server-side part of a new Ad-hoc Web application development framework.


Full description:

One of the main objective in the transformation process of the German Bundeswehr is to achieve the capability for Net-Centric Operations in joint and multinational scenarios. 
To gain this capability, it is essential to establish a context sensitive Shared Space of information, based on open international standards and fulfilling advanced operational and security requirements. 

After the successful releases of the ebXML OMARv32-SAML family on JoinUp, this release is the next significant step on a roadmap towards an Ad-hoc Web application development framework built upon the Shared Space.

This project is part of that framework and represents the server-side functionality organized in reusable building blocks to implement secure Web based applications. It enables Web-based applications or Web-Services to connect in a secure manner to an infrastructure of federated OASIS ebXML Registries, Solr Enterprise Search and WSS GeoServer backend services.

The AMES Web Service project is part of a family of other releases building the overall application development framework, see dependencies.

This project was funded by the German IT-Amt Bundeswehr under the contract E/IB1S/CA018/AF020 and released under GNU Public License Version 3 (GPLv3). 

The examples of the target audience include Enterprise, Government, NATO/PfP Partners, NGOs, public authorities, disaster relief management, etc.
